Resistor ladder for multiplexed decade counter switches

Cheaper than Adafruit, and since they're multiplexed for each digit, only need
to solder four obnoxious tiny surface-mount resistors instead of ten!

Switch has a common lead, then leads representing 1, 2, 4, and 8.  The digit
on the front panel corresponds to the sum of leads connected.  We will connect a
10K resistor across the common lead (cutting the trace), and measure voltage
across this resistor.  We will need to choose resistor values for each lead to
ensure the voltage level is discriminable for each state.

The digit 0 corresponds to no switches connected, so the voltage will be 0.

We don't require the full binary sense range, as the largest 4-bit word we will
need to read is 9 (1001).  For sense resistor value Rs (assuming 10K) and 1%
resistors:

R1 = 8.06 Rs
R2 = 4.02 Rs
R4 = 2.0 Rs
R8 = Rs

That provides the following sense voltages as a fraction of the supply voltage:
0: 0.0
1: 0.11
2: 0.199
3: 0.272
4: 0.333
5: 0.384
6: 0.428
7: 0.466
8: 0.5
9: 0.529

With a 10-bit ADC, we expect this to produce the following measurement values:
0: 0
1: 112
2: 203
3: 277
4: 341
5: 393
6: 438
7: 476
8: 511
9: 541


Resistor ladder design for decade counter switches

Connect a 10K resistor to common terminal, then ground.
Arduino measures voltage across this resistor.

Add one of these bias resistors to each digit circuit, then bus all to +5V.
This resistor series provides voltage reduction factor (alpha) increases of
approximately 0.1 per step, dividing the 5V measurement range into 10 bins.
The Arduino has a 10-bit ADC and measures using 5V comparison.

R       V       alpha       ADC val
180K    0.26    0.05        54
56K     0.76    0.15        155
30K     1.35    0.25        256
18K     1.79    0.36        365
12K     2.27    0.45        465
8.2K    2.74    0.55        562
5.6K    3.21    0.64        656
3.3K    3.76    0.75        769
1.8K    4.24    0.85        866
510     4.73    0.95        973

The largest resistor should go on the digit 0.
We'll use +-5% resistors.  These bins are even enough that we should just
be able to divide the full ADC range into 10 bins (1023/102) and call it good.
